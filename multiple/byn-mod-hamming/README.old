the files in this archive are

	README:	this very same file
	lsearch: library implementing our heuristics
	pubsearch.h: header to use the library (only a rudimentary
			interface is provided, enough to teach
			and research but not enough for commercial
			use).
	search: a more elaborate demonstration code


to use "search",

	search <pattern> <k> <file> <sigma> [options]

        where <sigma> is the alphabet size. if the alphabet is not uniform,
        use the inverse of the probability of two random characters
        matching (e.g. sum(p_i^2) if they are independently generated).
        sigma = 20 is normally ok for natural language.
        (this parameter helps to determine the type of partition to use,
         in the future the program will determine it by itself).
